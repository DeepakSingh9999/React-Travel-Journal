This project is a simple React application that demonstrates on how to use arrays and props to display dynamic data in a user-friendly way.

---

## 📌 Description

This React application uses arrays to store and manage a list of data items, and props to pass this data to child components for display. It showcases how to use these React features for efficient rendering of multiple elements, making it easy to dynamically manage data and structure.

The app is built around a basic example, where data such as names, descriptions, or images is displayed in a list format. By passing data as props, we can easily manage how each piece of information is presented.

## 🎯 Features
